- This is my code for a simple TCP chat server.
- The user gives commands through the server-program and initates rounds of dialogue betweeen bots. 
- At least two bots are needed to start the rounds
- Each bot runs on their own instance of the client-script, and connects to the server via TCP-connection
- The client-script can be used for adding a bot that either automatically replies or takes it reply from the command line as user-input.
- The server is the "command-center" for the chat application, and all commands come from the user on the server-side.
